# Netflix Content Strategization and Recommendation System

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing Netflix's content data and building a recommendation system to enhance user experience.

## Overview

Netflix has a vast collection of content, and understanding trends, genres, and audience preferences is key to strategizing future releases and improving recommendations. This project:

- Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix's dataset.
- Analyzes content genres, release trends, and audience preferences.
- Implements a recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to suggest content based on description similarity scores.

## Features

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized content release trends, genre distributions, and audience preferences using:
  - **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: In-depth visualizations.
- Extracted key patterns from Netflix's content data.

### 2. Recommendation System

- Applied **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature extraction from content descriptions.
- Calculated similarity scores using **Cosine Similarity** to recommend content.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Tools**:
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
  - **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning and NLP techniques.
